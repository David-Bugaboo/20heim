# STABLE

To acquire a mount, a warband must first purchase the Stable base resource. A mount then costs 200 coroas. Such is the burden a mount places on resources, a warband may only ever have one mount at a time.

### Fielding Mounted Models

To bring a mount to a scenario, simply add it to a model’s items, taking up one slot. Any model may ride a mount, with the exception of Animals, Undead, Demons and Constructs. The mount and the rider count as a single model and may never be separated. The mount give bonuses and penalties to the rider’s stats according to each kind of mount. A rider may not dismount once it start the game mounted, except by rolling the **Heavy Landing** result on the “Whoa, Boy\!” table.

### Rough Ground

Rough Ground affects mounted figures as it does any other model. In addition, however, every time a model’s movement action is affected by an area of Rough Ground, roll a die and consult the “Whoa, Boy\!” table.

### Jumping

Horses may jump as normal but, upon landing, must roll on the Whoa, Boy\!Table with a \+4 modifier.

### Climbing

Unlike other Soldiers, a mounted Soldier may never scale a structure.

### Carrying Treasure

A mounted Soldier may pick up and carry treasure as normal , but must spend an entire activation to do so. Like any Soldier, a mounted model may carry only one treasure token at once. A Mounted figure does not suffer a movement penalty for carrying treasure.

### Size

The rider and his mount count as a single target, and are considered to be a Large target (Frostgrave, p.40). Use a base of 40mm+ to represent the pair.

A spellcaster may cast Lure of Chaos or Master Voice. If successful, roll using the Rider’s will roll. If the Will roll fails, roll on the Whoa, Boy\! table with a \+7 modifier.
