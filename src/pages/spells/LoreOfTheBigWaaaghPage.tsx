            The Lore of the Big WAAAGH! is the brutal, primal magic of the Greenskins.
            Powered by the collective psychic energy of Gork (who is brutally cunning)
            and Mork (who is cunningly brutal), these spells manifest as raw destructive
            force. Orc Shamans channel the WAAAGH! energy that builds up when Orcs and
            Goblins gather in large numbers, turning it into devastating magical attacks
            that can crush heads, throw enemies around like ragdolls, and make da boyz
            even 'arder than usual. WAAAGH!
