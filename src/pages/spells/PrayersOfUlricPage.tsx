            Ulric, the God of Winter, Wolves, and War, is the ancient patron deity of
            the northern tribes. His priests are fierce warriors who embody the savage
            strength of the wolf and the merciless cold of winter. Through their
            prayers, they can summon blizzards, transform into great wolves, and imbue
            their allies with the fury of battle. The Prayers of Ulric are a testament
            to primal strength and the harsh realities of survival in the frozen north.
