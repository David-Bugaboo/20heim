A successful casting of this spell will remove all permanent injuries from one figure. For example, a wizard suffering from Lost Fingers regrows all their missing digits, regardless of how many times they have suffered that particular injury. Or, it may be cast on a Badly Wounded figure – if successful, the soldier is healed and may participate in the next game with no penalty. Finally, it may be used to attempt to bring a figure back from the dead. The figure must have died in the game just played, and using the spell in this fashion incurs a -4 penalty to the Casting Roll. If successful, the figure is restored to life, and may participate in the next game with no penalty. If Gift of Isha is cast using a scroll, it cannot be used to resurrect the dead.",

If this pushes the target into the edge of the table or a piece of terrain over ½" high, they stop immediately. Other figures do not stop (or get hit by) a pushed figure – they are assumed to step out of the way. If this spell is cast from beneath a figure it will push them up. If the target is pushed up or off a height, it suffers falling damage as normal. This spell can push a figure out of combat, and as it is not a shooting attack, the target is not randomized.',
