Every figure within 8\" of the caster (but not the caster) must make an immediate Move Roll (TN20). Large creatures get +2 to this roll. If the figure fails, it is knocked prone. While prone, a figure is -2 Fight, -2 Shoot, and -2 to all Casting Rolls and may not take a move action. A figure can get back to their feet simply by spending a move action. This requires the full move action.",

This can be the wall of a building or cave, a cliff-face, a statue, or even a free-standing stone. While the caster is within 12" of this stone, they may empower all of their spells and Will Rolls on a 1-for-1 basis (one Health for one increase to the roll) instead of the 2-for-1 that is normal. In addition, the caster may use the stone as a Scrying Eye. A caster may have two of these stones active at any one time, but they must be at least 36" apart. A caster may not have an Obsidian Obelisk and a Scrying Eye spell active at the same time. A caster may cancel any casting of this spell at any time. Obsidian Obelisks may be destroyed but are immune to non-magic attacks. Treat an obelisk as Fight +0, Armour 22, Health 1.

It is assumed that the spellcaster has forged a demonic construct prior to using this spell to animate it. If the spell is successfully cast, the construct immediately becomes a permanent member of the warband, taking the place of a soldier. A spellcaster must declare the type of construct they are attempting to animate (barghest, forge-daemon, or Bronze Bull) before rolling to cast the spell. The larger the construct, the harder it is to animate, so the following modifiers are applied to the Casting Roll: Barghest -0, Forge-Daemon -3, Bronze Bull -6. There is no limit to the number of constructs in a warband other than the normal limits for soldiers. Large constructs count as specialist soldiers, the others as standard soldiers.",

If cast on armour, the target gains +1 Armour for the rest of the game. This spell may be cast on a single arrow or crossbow bolt, in which case that ammunition gives +1 Shoot and its attack counts as magic, but for the next shooting attack only. When cast Out of Game after a battle, this spell causes any one weapon or armour enchanted by Runes of Zharr-Naggrund that is still active at the end of the game to become permanently infused with demonic power, becoming a true magic item. The newly forged magic weapon or armour takes up an item slot as normal.",
