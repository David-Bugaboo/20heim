              The Possessed and Mutants are warriors whose bodies have become
              vessels for demonic entities and chaotic corruption. As the daemon
              within grows stronger, it manifests physical and supernatural
              attributes that warp both flesh and soul. These daemonic
              attributes represent the terrible gifts bestowed upon those who
              have surrendered themselves to the powers of Chaos.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>For Possessed:</strong> When a Possessed is first hired,
              the warband may purchase Daemonic Attributes for them,
              representing the initial stage of their corruption. As the
              Possessed gains experience and levels up, they may choose to
              embrace further corruption by gaining additional attributes
              instead of improving their base statistics. Each attribute costs
              50gc, with each additional attribute costing 50gc more than the
              previous (50gc for first, 100gc for second, 150gc for third,
              etc.).
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>For Mutants:</strong> When a Mutant is first hired, they
              may purchase one Daemonic Attribute for 50gc. Each time a Mutant
              gains a level, they may choose to purchase another Demonic
              Attribute instead of gaining stat points. Each additional
              attribute costs 50gc more than the previous one (50gc for first,
              100gc for second, 150gc for third, etc.).
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Vessels of Chaos:</strong> Both Possessed and Mutants
              manifest the physical marks of their corruption, making them
              increasingly monstrous with each transformation. However, each
              figure may only manifest each specific attribute once â€” the
              daemon's essence shapes the host in unique ways that cannot be
              replicated.

              The Magister of Chaos has sold a fragment of his soul to the
              daemons of the Realm of Chaos. This terrible bargain grants him
              dark power, but binds him ever more tightly to the infernal forces
              that now hold pieces of his very essence. Each daemon that claims
              a soul fragment demands a Sacrifice â€” a regular offering that
              maintains the connection between the mortal world and the warp. To
              refuse is to risk the daemon consuming what remains of the
              Magister's soul.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Selling Soul Fragments:</strong> When first creating the
              Magister and at every 10 levels thereafter, his soul grows so
              saturated with dark power that he may sell another fragment. With
              each fragment sold, the Magister must select one Sacrifice from
              the list below. This Sacrifice represents the specific price
              demanded by the daemon who claimed that fragment. Once chosen, it
              cannot be changed â€” the contract is written in blood and essence.
              <br />

              <strong>The Price of Power:</strong>
              <ul style={{ marginLeft: "1.5rem", marginTop: "0.5rem" }}>
                <li>
                  Each Sacrifice must be performed before every game (or
                  during/after as specified)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Failure to perform a Sacrifice severs the connection to that
                  soul fragment and its associated Boon
                </li>
                <li>
                  The same Sacrifice cannot be selected for multiple soul
                  fragments â€” each daemon has unique demands
                </li>
                <li>
                  The more fragments sold, the more the Magister becomes a
                  puppet of the dark powers
                </li>
              </ul>

              For each soul fragment sold (and Sacrifice performed), the daemon
              grants the Magister a Boon â€” a dark gift that flows from the
              fragment of essence it now possesses. These boons represent the
              unholy power channeled through the connection between the Magister
              and the Realm of Chaos. As more fragments are sold, the Magister
              accumulates terrible abilities, but his very identity begins to
              dissolve into the warp.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Receiving Boons:</strong> For each soul fragment sold (and
              corresponding Sacrifice chosen), the Magister may select one Boon
              from the list below. This selection is permanent for that specific
              fragment â€” the nature of the daemon's gift is sealed at the moment
              of the soul's sundering.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>The Chains of Damnation:</strong>
              <ul style={{ marginLeft: "1.5rem", marginTop: "0.5rem" }}>
                <li>
                  Each Boon is tied to its corresponding soul fragment and
                  Sacrifice
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Sacrifice is not performed, the connection to that
                  fragment (and its Boon) is severed
                </li>
                <li>
                  The same Boon cannot be selected for multiple fragments â€” each
                  piece of the soul grants unique power
                </li>
                <li>
                  With each fragment sold, less of the Magister's humanity
                  remains
                </li>
