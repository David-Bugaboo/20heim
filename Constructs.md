# Construct Modifications

While constructs have no item slots, and thus can never carry items, they can  
be ‘modified’ to change their capabilities. In most cases, this will improve one  
aspect of the construct, say their fighting ability, at the cost of some other  
aspect, such as speed. A wizard may attempt to modify a construct either at  
the time of its creation or before any game in which the construct is set to  
participate. No construct may have more than one modification.  
The next section contains a list of modifications than can be made  
to a construct, presented as a table, followed by the specific rules for  
those modifications (see page 12). It also includes the parts cost for each  
modification. This table can also be used as a Treasure Table (and is, in some  
of the scenarios in this book). If players are using the Black Market optional  
rules (see Frostgrave, Page 104), they may trade up to two of their rolls on the  
Treasure Table after each game for rolls on the Construct Modification Table  
to see what is available to purchase.  
Once a wizard has the parts for a modification, they may store them in  
their vault until such time as they wish to use them to modify a construct.  
To create a new construct featuring the modification, they must successfully  
cast Animate Construct with an additional \-2 penalty to the Casting Roll. This  
is cumulative with the penalty for the size of the construct, so attempting  
to create a new, large construct with a modification incurs a \-8 penalty to  
the Casting Roll. If the roll is successful, the construct is created with the  
modification. Its stats should be modified appropriately, and the parts should  
be removed from the wizard’s vault as they have been used. If the Casting Roll  
fails, the construct is not created, but the parts remain in the vault for further  
attempts.  
Modifying an existing construct follows basically the same rules, except that  
the wizard just makes the Casting Roll at \-2 for the modification; the size of  
the construct is not factored in. If successful, the construct is modified. If the  
roll fails, the construct is not modified, but it may participate in the next game  
as normal, and the parts remain in the vault.  
Modifying a construct does not change its status as either a standard or  
specialist soldier, unless the modification specifically states this.

This construct can repair itself. Perhaps it is composed of material that can flow  
around and refill damaged areas or maybe it carries tools to work on its own  
broken parts. Whatever the mechanism, each time the construct activates, it  
may spend one action (which can replace the move action) to repair one point  
of damage, up to its starting Health. It may even do this while in combat.
