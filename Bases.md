a Warband may choose to move into a base whenever they find such a base in an exploration event. Moving into a base is free, but base upgrades are lost when doing so.

| Base | Effect |
| ----- | ----- |
| Inn | This old inn has plenty of room to house soldiers and their gear. The player may keep an extra soldier in their warband. However, this extra soldier cannot be used in a game and must remain in the base. Even with an inn, a warband is still limited to eight soldiers in a game. The player may change which soldier is left in the inn each game, which is useful if a soldier must miss a game due to injury. |
| Ruined Temple | The ruins of this once-holy building still have the trappings for performing sacred (or profane) rituals. If the warband have a Priest, it gains an Holy-Unholy relic once between each game. Out of Game prayers are at \+3 to their casting rolls in the temple. |
| Mausoleum | It’s not the most comfortable place to sleep, but it is full of ‘supplies’. A warband with a necromancer gains \+3 to any castings of Raise Undead outside of game.  |
| Observatory | This half-ruined imperial observatory allows the player to scout and map Mordheim easily. The tower grants a \+2 to initiative and to casting rolls of any spell that allow the player to re-rolls on the treasure table. |
| Bank | This bank has remained relatively untouched and many of its vaults are still sealed. After each game, the warband may attempt to open a vault. Roll one die. If the result is 2–16 add that many gold crowns to the warband’s treasury. If a 17–18 is rolled, add 100gc to that number. If a 19–20 is rolled, the warband finds a Nobles Safe – determine the contents of this safe in the same way as rolling for a Wyrdstone Shard secured during a game.  |
| Dwarven Brewery | There is still some life left in those old casks, and the warband takes full advantage. All soldiers start each game with \+1 Will. Furthermore, the warband gains an additional 20gc after each game through the sale of excess stock. A undead figure never benefits for these bonuses, except for vampires. |
| University | This is one of the many University campuses scattered throughout the city. The volumes contained within this one have fallen to the ravages of weather and time. A few valuable texts have survived, however. After each game the warband may roll one die. On a 15–18, they find a random scroll. On a 19–20 they discover a random grimoire. |
| Training Grounds | A mostly intact training ground for the city watch and their battle wizards. A Hero gains 20 experience points after each game from training their body and mind here. This does not count against the 300 experience point maximum for each game. |
