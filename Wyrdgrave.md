# Tides of Hoeth

## **Tides of Hoeth – Design Identity**

Tides of Hoeth represents the harmonious interplay between mastery of arcane power and protective strategy. The warband is built around the symbiosis of the **Loremaster** and the **Phoenix Guardiann**, creating a duality of offense and defense, intelligence and raw battlefield control.

**Core principles of the design:**

- **Linked Synergy:** Most powers revolve around the proximity and coordination between the Loremaster and the Phoenix Guardiann. Their abilities reinforce each other, making positioning and timing critical. The identity emphasizes teamwork over individual heroics.

- **Protective Control:** Powers like _Shield of the Tempest_ and _Coralwall Formation_ highlight a defensive mindset — the Phoenix Guardian shields the fragile Loremaster, creating zones of safety that reward careful placement.

- **Reactive Power Flow:** Several abilities, such as _Reflecting Pool_ and _Surge of the Tides_, allow the Phoenix Guardian to act in response to the Loremaster’s failures, turning potential setbacks into tactical opportunities. This gives the warband a dynamic, reactive feel.

- **Battlefield Manipulation:** Movement and combat control are recurring motifs. _Gale Step_, _Deflection of the Currents_, _Tidal Currents_, and _Steel Typhon_ let the Phoenix Guardian reposition allies or enemies, enforce engagement, and extend influence beyond normal reach.

- **Echoing and Amplification:** Abilities like _Echoing of the Waves_ and _Rippling Waves_ create feedback loops, where attacks build on one another and damage can cascade across the battlefield. This makes the warband feel alive, like ripples spreading through the waves.

- **Spell Integration:** The Loremaster’s magic is central to the warband’s identity. Many powers either boost spellcasting or convert magical effects into tangible battlefield advantages, blending wizardry with tactical might.

**In short:** Tides of Hoeth is designed to make the warband feel like a **living, moving system**, where protection, magic, and combat amplify each other. The interplay between the Phoenix Guardian and Loremaster rewards foresight, positioning, and timing, creating a unique style of tactical gameplay rooted in synergy, control, and cascading effects.

# Wardog Tactics

**Wardog Tactics – Design Identity**  
 Wardog Tactics represent the brutal discipline of mercenary packs driven by survival, fear, and raw aggression. Their design emphasizes **collective synergy over individual power**, with abilities that ripple through the warband and turn scattered fighters into a single, snarling unit.

Core principles of the design:

- **Pack Cohesion**: Most tactics provide bonuses to multiple figures at once, reinforcing the idea of warriors moving and fighting as a mob under shouted commands.

- **Battlefield Adaptability**: Orders shift the flow of combat — bolstering defenses, accelerating charges, or unleashing sudden counterattacks when the enemy presses too close.

- **Brutal Efficiency**: The tactics avoid flashy maneuvers in favor of simple, ruthless advantages that keep the warband alive and dangerous. The strength comes not from precision, but from relentless pressure.

- **Identity of Fear and Fury**: The flavor reflects commanders who motivate with threats, bloodlust, and crude inspiration, capturing the sense of a pack of warhounds unleashed at their master’s signal.

In short, Wardog Tactics are designed to make the warband fight like a single organism — less elegant than others, but brutally effective through shared momentum and merciless aggression.

# Bloodline Traditions

## **Bloodline Traditions – Design Identity**

Bloodline Traditions embody the monstrous legacy of vampiric power — ancient curses, feral transformations, and unholy dominion over both blood and will. Their design emphasizes the vampire as the warband’s terrifying centerpiece, bending the battlefield through personal might and supernatural presence.

**Core principles of the design:**

- **Predation Through Blood:** Many traditions revolve around Bleed tokens and draining life, turning wounds into resources. The vampire thrives on the suffering of others.

- **Supernatural Transformation:** Shifting into mist, bats, rats, or dire wolves reinforces the idea of the vampire as a creature of endless, terrifying shapes. Each form unlocks mobility, resilience, or sudden bursts of violence.

- **Domination of the Weak:** Traditions like Charming, Transfixing, and Seduction represent the vampire’s ability to enslave minds, bend foes into pawns, or strip enemies of their agency entirely.

- **Cursed Nobility:** Tyranny and similar effects extend control over undead, marking the vampire as both a warlord and a cursed monarch, feeding the identity of a dark lord ruling over thralls.

- **Risk and Fury:** Traditions such as Red Fury show the vampire’s volatile nature — devastating when blood flows, but punished if denied prey. This creates a high-drama, all-or-nothing rhythm.

**In short:** Bloodline Traditions are designed to make the vampire feel like a gothic monster-king — a predator, shapeshifter, and tyrant in one body. Their identity is singular and theatrical, ensuring every activation feels like a scene from a vampire legend: blood spilled, wills broken, and darkness unleashed.

### Tradition of the Chittering Mass

**Effect:** The vampire turns into a Swarm of Voracious Rats. This creature may move through terrain as though it were not there, provided it has enough movement to reach the other side (it cannot end its movement within a solid piece of terrain). Furthermore, the creature never suffers any movement penalty for climbing or moving over rough ground. The vampire can move through enemy figures as well, and when doing so, cannot be forced into combat, and deals 3 damage to any creature it passes through.

### Tradition of the Moonhunting

# Clan Enshin Martial Arts

**Clan Enshin Martial Arts – Design Identity**  
 The Clan Enshin styles are designed as a toolkit of **deadly disciplines for assassins**, each representing a secret technique that twists the flow of battle in their favor. Their design identity is rooted in **mobility, deception, and surgical lethality**. Instead of granting broad or constant advantages, they deliver **sharp, situational bursts of power** that allow the assassin to dictate when and how engagements occur.

Core principles of the design:

- **Fluid Movement**: Many styles grant ways to bypass terrain, leap impossible distances, or reposition unpredictably. Movement is treated as both defense and offense, reflecting an assassin’s ability to appear and vanish at will.

- **Predatory Control**: The powers allow the assassin to choose fights on their own terms — evading shots, denying line of sight, or forcing drops of precious objectives. These tools emphasize _control through fear and precision_.

- **Explosive Lethality**: When striking, styles provide sudden critical hits, boosted damage, or decisive action spikes. These are not sustained advantages, but _momentary flashes of overwhelming force_.

- **Supernatural Presence**: Thematically, the martial arts blur the line between skill and sorcery. Disappearing into shadows, reappearing in ambush, or becoming untouchable at range reinforces the assassin as something more than a mere killer — a wraithlike predator.

In short, the Clan Enshin Martial Arts are designed to make the assassin feel like an unpredictable blade in the dark: elusive, precise, and terrifying when unleashed at the right moment.

### Shadow Step Style

**When:** At the start of the Assassin’s activation**.**  
**Effect:** For the rest of the activation the Assassin’s may move through terrain, including rough ground and water, as though it were not there. The Assassin must have enough movement to move completely through any solid piece of terrain before its activation ends – a Assassin may never end his activation inside a piece of terrain, but may end it in water.

### Night Stalker Style

**When:** Any time the Assassin is named as the target of a shooting  
attack from a figure**.** Additionally, the Assassin must either be in cover, or there must  
be intervening terrain between the shooter and the Assassin.  
**Effect:**The Assassin suddenly blends in with the surrounding terrain, and the shot automatically misses without any shooting rolls being made. This ability may not be used while the Assassin is in combat, nor does it have any effect on shooting attacks that do not originate from a figure. It does apply to shooting attacks caused by Spells.

### Black Hunger Style

**When:** Whenever the Assassin has won a combat and rolled an unmodified 18 or 19 on the die (before any modifiers are taken into account).  
**Effect:** Treat this hit as a critical hit.

### Dashing Rat Style

**When:** During the Assassin’s Activation.  
**Effect:** For the rest of the activation, the Assassin receives \+4 to his Move and takes no falling damage.

### Wyrdblade Style

**When:** at the start of a Assassin’s activation before any actions are taken.  
**Effect:** For the rest of the turn, the Assassin counts as if he is armed with a magic  
weapon which gives him \+2 Fight. If the Assassin is already using a magic or superior  
weapon, this effect replaces any Fight bonuses from that weapon, although damage  
bonuses and other special abilities are retained.

### Chittering Arrow Style

**When:** At any point the Assassin’s makes a Shooting Attack.  
**Effect:** No modifiers for cover or intervening terrain are applied to the shot. The  
Assassin must still have line of sight in order to declare the shot.

### Flying Death Style

**When:** At any point the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** The Assassin can use anaction to make a ‘Leap’ move instead of a normal move. In a Leap, the Assassin may move up to his full movement allowance in a straight line, in any direction (including straight upwards), provided that line is free of obstacles. Thus, it is possible to jump over or onto terrain and other obstacles, provided the angle is right. If this move ends with the Assassin in the air, immediately move it back down to the table and take falling damage as appropriate. Leap may not be used while a Assassin is in combat. If the Assassin wants to make a second movement action in the turn, it is at half move as  
normal. Alternatively, an Assassin may combine two actions and utilize this action to  
make one Leap of up to 1.5 times his Move. Assassins carrying treasure still halve their  
movement when making a Leap.

### God’s Horn Style

**When:** At any point the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** The next time this figure makes a Shooting attack with a hand crossbow or pistol, the shot does \+3 Damage. This is cumulative with other damage modifiers for the weapon.

### Swarm of Stings Style

**When:** At any point during the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** The Assassin receives an extra action. This extra action cannot be movement (so the Assassin can take a maximum of two movement actions during his turn). This may not take the Assassin above three actions.

### Hungry Hands Style

**When:** At any point during the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** This power may only be used against a soldier carrying a Wyrdstone Shard within 2” of the Assassin. That figure must make an immediate Fight Roll (TN14). If failed, the figure immediately drops the loot token and the Assassin may move it up to 4” in any direction and Pick up the Wyrdstone Shard.

### Horned Wraith Style

**When:** At any point during the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** No figure may draw line of sight to this figure if it is more than 12” away and it gains \+2 Fight when rolling against Shooting attacks until the end of the turn.

### Void Killer Style

**When:** At any point during the Assassin’s activation.  
**Effect:** As an action, the assassin is removed from the table. Then, during it’s next activation, as an action, it may then be positioned at any point that is not within 8” of an enemy figure and outside of every enemy figure line of sight. If a enemy figure is outside of light of sight of every other figure of it’s warband, the Assassin may be setup in combat with it.

# **Inquisition Edicts**

**Inquisition Edicts – Design Identity**  
 The Inquisition Edicts are battlefield decrees that embody authority, zeal, and ruthless judgment. They are not mere tricks or tactics, but proclamations of faith and law that reshape the fight through fear, control, and fanatic conviction. Their design emphasizes **targeted suppression, divine punishment, and the rallying of allies under uncompromising will**.

Core principles of the design:

- **Moral Authority as Power**: Edicts mark enemies as condemned, weaken spellcasters, and restrict foes’ ability to act. The Inquisitor does not just fight — he enforces judgment.

- **Punishment and Retribution**: Many abilities trigger when enemies falter or resist, turning their own aggression or sorcery into opportunities for pain, fire, and critical strikes.

- **Fanatic Support**: Edicts can resurrect allies, fuel them with hatred, or sharpen their resolve. The warband gains strength not from coordination alone, but from zealotry and unwavering devotion to the cause.

The Slayer Sagas capture the essence of the Trollslayer as a relentless, single-minded predator of monstrous foes. Their design emphasizes **ferocity, resilience, and escalating brutality**, reflecting a hero who grows stronger as the battle intensifies and thrives on taking extreme risks.

Core principles of the design:

- **Relentless Offense**: Many Sagas reward repeated attacks, critical strikes, or extra damage when the Slayer confronts large or dangerous foes, reinforcing the theme of single-minded vengeance.

- **High-Risk, High-Reward**: Powers like Recklessness or Inebriating Hatred encourage aggressive play at the cost of personal danger, creating a tension between survival and maximum impact.

- **Mobility as Combat Tool**: Leaps, pursuit movements, and battlefield positioning allow the Slayer to engage enemies on his own terms, turning terrain and opportunity into lethal advantage.

- **Unstoppable Resilience**: Sagas such as Stoneflesh and Unflinching Will reflect near-supernatural endurance, allowing the Trollslayer to recover from devastating hits and continue the hunt.

Their design emphasizes **mechanical innovation, battlefield versatility, and high-risk/high-reward engineering**, offering effects that can drastically shift the tide of battle when deployed correctly.

Core principles of the design:

- **Technological Superiority**: Masterpieces often grant raw power — heavily armored constructs, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, or enhanced weapons — turning ordinary soldiers into devastating assets.

- **Strategic Flexibility**: Many effects allow movement, terrain manipulation, or remote control of hazards, giving the warband options to react creatively to threats and objectives.

- **Resource Management**: These powers are rare, costly, or require upkeep, reinforcing the theme of careful planning and investment for maximum battlefield impact.

- **Synergy with Constructs**: A large portion of Masterpieces interact directly with constructs, enhancing their combat potential and integrating them into the warband’s strategy.
